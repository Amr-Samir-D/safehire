# Step 07 â€” CI Workflow & PRs


**Objective:** Add GitHub Actions for backend tests and open PRs for earlier branches.


**Tasks:**
- Add `.github/workflows/ci-backend.yml` to run tests on PRs.
- Open PRs for `task/step-01` through `task/step-06` (or group logically per milestone).


**Deliverable:** `step_07_results.md` with workflow run logs (if triggered) and PR links.
